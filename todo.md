Add save profiles (My idea is if you want to save a profile you can just use zip all the current mods and you can name it and add description then you can load it back)
Check for updates (Check for updates that are in the same version and compatible for minecraft and fabric loader versions, check the versions from modyrinth website using httpx and request!)
